            Hello, My name is Demetri Dillard. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York City along with seven of my
            Siblings; 4 Sisters, 3 Brothers, and me being the middle child. I lived in Brooklyn until the age of 14 when
            I decided to move to Minnesota after visiting the summer of 1996. In Minnesota, I attended Como Senior High
            School in St. Paul where I graduated in 2001. I then went on to working various jobs in the field of
            laborer, carpentry, and sales for a few years which led to my current job of 13 years working for Maplewood
            School District as a Custodial Engineer.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            Growing up from humble beginnings has taught me to be very resilient, self-motivated, and responsible. I
            have always been a very inquisitive person wanting to learn how things work which has caused me to
            self-study many different skill sets such as Djing, Japanese, Stock Trading, and now computer programming
            just to mention a few. In the past, I attended ITT Technical College in the study of IT Networking. There,
            is where I found my passion for Computer Programming. I managed to get a year of schooling under my belt but
            wasn't satisfied with the curriculum and the teaching practices at ITT, so I decided to focus on work and
            building one of my passions into a home business; Djing that is. A self-taught DJ, I was now running an
            at-home business with mediocre success. With the extra income, I managed to pay off all of my debt and
            wanted to invest in myself further, particularly in the field of Programming.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            After months of researching schools and programs, a friend told me about The University of Minnesota Coding
            Bootcamp. I've looked into these boot camps in the past but always thought they were a waste of time or even
            a scam. Now this one was different, it was accredited by a very reputable University so I decided to join.
            Going forward, I would like to pursue a career in Software Development. I feel that I have a lot to bring to
            this field because I am eager to learn challenging and difficult task. Being autodidactic in nature gives me
            the ability to study complex ideas and concept with almost
